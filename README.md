**Purpose**

With the fast-paced lifestyle people seem to follow, there appears to be no time to take a break. Slowing down is equivalent to going backward. Imagine that you may forget to buy flowers when you're rushing to a date, or you may find that you've forgotten to bring the PowerPoint presentation you loaded onto your USB drive when you get to the office. Thus, the demand for lightning-fast and convenient delivery services for all kinds of items is high and growing. Once it gathers attention, its popularity can spread far and wide. 

In order to tackle this dilemma, our App, PostMan, which can find a delivery person nearby to run errands with only a few taps on the phone screen, would come in handy. PostMan is a task-based product where users can post tasks to deliver items to friends/partners by delivery people as soon as possible or pick up items for them from grocery stores, convenience stores, residential addresses, and more in the surrounding area. Our product features real-time tracking by means of which users can easily track their items on an embedded map as it is on the way. From delivery time to traffic, we’ve factored in all the elements that come between users and their items. See the estimated delivery time to your address. Get notified when the items arrive. While users are spending more time doing the things more important, we’ll take care of the rest. 

Meanwhile, we hope our App will build stronger communities where people are connected with the best in their cities. We fulfill this by optimizing a cutting-edge person-to-person delivery App so as to generate new ways for people to earn, work and live.
